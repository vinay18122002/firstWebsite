    <h2>A few facts about the world we live in</h2>
    <img src="./earth.jpeg" alt="earth-image">
    <p>Earth, third planet from the Sun and the fifth largest planet in the solar system in terms of size and mass. Its
        single most outstanding feature is that its near-surface environments are the only places in the universe known
        to harbour life. It is designated by the symbol ♁. Earth’s name in English, the international language of
        astronomy, derives from Old English and Germanic words for ground and earth, and it is the only name for a
        planet of the solar system that does not come from Greco-Roman mythology. Earth is part of the "observable
        universe," the region of space that humans can actually or theoretically observe with the aid of technology.
        Unlike the observable universe, the universe is possibly infinite.</p>

    <h2>Top facts about the Earth</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Earth is the third planet from the Sun in our solar system and the only known celestial body to support
            life.</li>
        <li>It has a diverse composition, including solid layers (core, mantle, crust), a life-sustaining atmosphere
            primarily composed of nitrogen and oxygen, and a rich biodiversity that spans millions of species.</li>
        <li>Earth experiences a dynamic geology with tectonic plate movements causing earthquakes and volcanic activity,
            while its axial tilt and orbit around the Sun contribute to the planet's varying climates and seasons.</li>
